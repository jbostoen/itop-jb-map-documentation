## What?
Merges any sub class of Tickets.

One Ticket is chosen as "target" Ticket. The user decides which ticket will be kept as main Ticket, and which ones will be merged.

The attribute types to be merged are:
* ```AttributeCaseLog```
  Merges case log entries (sorted chronologically!). 
  There's an option to append/prepend a new log entry.
* ```AttributeLinkedSet```
  Related work orders, ...
* ```AttributeLinkedSetIndirect```  
  Related functional CIs, functional Contacts, ...

Attachments may be copied to the target Ticket.

**Options**

* specify which attributes can be merged, which ones are merged by default, which ones are always merged (forced), ...

* add callers from merged Tickets on the related contacts tab of the target Ticket. This allows Notifications to be sent to everyone linked to this Ticket.
* add description from merged Tickets as a case log entry (for example in public_log).

* New triggers
  * Trigger On Ticket Merge Source Processed
    * Offers access to information about this one source Ticket (excludes target Ticket!)
    * Placeholders: current_contact_id, current_contact_friendlyname, current_date, current_time and target_object
    * Use case: inform the caller of the source Tickets that their Ticket has been merged with the target Ticket (and give that Ticket's reference)
  * Trigger On Ticket Merge Target Processed
    * Offers acces to information about the target Ticket only
    * Placeholders: current_contact_id, current_contact_friendlyname, current_date, current_time
    * Use case: notify caller and now related contacts on target Ticket that Tickets have been merged and others will now receive notifications too.

**Work in progress*

* perform actions on target object as well as merged objects, similar to Combodo's User Actions Configurator.
  * on all objects: apply stimulus (so they can be resolved/closed automatically), set attributes, append log entries, ...
  * retrofit from target object to merged objects: copy (attributes), copy_head (most recent case log entry)


## Out of scope
Ideas which will only get implemented when sponsored:
* merge Tickets into new Ticket instead of existing one
* merge different child classes of Tickets into one
* detailed history track (which log entries, linked sets, attachments, ... were merged and from which original Ticket?)
