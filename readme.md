# Available extensions

* [Maps](jb-map)  
  Add geometry (point, linestring, polygon) to iTop objects.  
  This also comes with a map dashlet.

* [Suggested FAQs](jb-faq)  
  Relieve the workload of your agents and improve customer satisfaction by suggesting FAQs 
  to users while they are creating a new ticket in the iTop web portal 
  or to agents who are handling the ticket and need to send a reply (log entry).  
  
* [Ticket merge](jb-ticket-merge)  
  Merge tickets.  
  If a user sends new info or requests a status update, you can now merge this into one ticket.  
  This allows you to keep track of unique open tickets.

* [Two factor authentication](jb-login-authenticator) (TOTP-code)  
  Add two factor authentication to traditional login methods.  
  Users can pick their favorite authenticator app (Authenticator extension, Authy, Google, Microsoft, ...) to securely log in.
